# JS-Tetris
Simple javascript tetris i made for practicing logic. 
Features I plan on adding:
  - Menu;
  - Row Clearing animation;
  - Improving the Score count;
  - Textures to the tetrominoes;
  - Controls for mouse and touch-screen.
 
 Controls: 
 - Arrow keys for moving left/right and droping the Tetrominoe.
 - Q/W for rotating the Tetrominoe.
 - Spacebar for pausing.
